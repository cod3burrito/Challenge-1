Challenge-1

The motivation to fix this website was that it was very aesthetic but its code was clunky and overall it was not very accessible. Every image has an alt text description, and all the links are corrected. (One image does have alt text as a comment in the CSS.)

During this project, I learned to not overthink problems and that semantics stretch beyond my lingustic studies. I look forward to more problem solving like this in the future.
